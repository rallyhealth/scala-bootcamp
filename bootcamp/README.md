# Welcome to Scala Bootcamp!

Scala Bootcamp is an open-source training program developed by Rally Health to help experienced engineers who are new to Scala become productive in approximately two weeks.  If you don't work for Rally, this training can prepare you to do so or at least introduce you to an approach to Scala that we feel is practical and useful.  And if you are a new Rally engineer, welcome!  And enjoy the journey!

*(_For guests who aren't Rally employees_: Some of the links under "Now you do it!" resolve to internal Rally resources.)*

## Getting started

Most engineers come to Rally with little or no professional Scala experience.  Further, some experienced Rally developers transfer from parts of the company that use C# or other languages. Here, we help you get started by bridging between what you can find via Google and how to apply that information at Rally.

This information is organized in unique two-week learning cycles with specific goals for each cycle.  Most articles are short and focus on a single technique or concept.

## Tips

* Join the Scala Bootcamp chat room (Rally engineers only)
* Work with your new hire buddy, your manager and your team
* Take your time
* Ask questions
* Provide feedback
